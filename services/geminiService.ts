Instructions:
1.  **Create a Learning Path:** Break this domain down into a logical sequence of 5-7 learning steps.
2.  **Detail Each Step:** For each step, provide:
    - A clear title (e.g., "Step 1: HTML Fundamentals").
    - A concise \`description\` of what the user will learn and why it's important.
    - A \`detailedDescription\`: A more in-depth explanation (2-3 sentences) covering the core concepts and real-world applications of this step.
    - A list of \`keyTopics\`: An array of 3-5 essential topics or skills to master for this step (e.g., "Semantic HTML", "Forms and Inputs", "Accessibility").
    - \`prerequisites\`: A list of required knowledge. For the first step, list general foundational skills (e.g., "Basic computer literacy"). For subsequent steps, list the titles of *previous steps* in this pathway that are required.
    - A list of 1-2 fictional, but realistic, learning resources (like online courses).
3.  **Format Resources:** For each resource, you MUST provide the following details:
    - \`id\`: a unique kebab-case string (e.g., 'html-essentials-course').
    - \`name\`: The course name (e.g., "HTML5 Essentials for Beginners").
    - \`provider\`: A fictional provider (e.g., "CodeAcademy Pro", "Techflix").
    - \`icon\`: A single, relevant emoji.
    - \`category\`: A category slug based on the domain (e.g., 'web-dev', 'game-dev').
    - \`description\`: A short, compelling course description.
    - \`difficulty\`: 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', or 'Advanced'.
    - \`duration\`: An estimated time to complete (e.g., "4 weeks").
    - \`rating\`: A number between 4.0 and 5.0.
    - \`reviewCount\`: A realistic number of reviews (e.g., 15230).

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of step objects, with no other text or markdown.`;

---
**Course Name:** ${course.name}
**Course URL:** ${course.url}
---
**Available Certifications:**
${candidateSummary}
---
**Instructions:**
1.  **Primary Goal: Identify Prerequisites.** Your most important task is to use Google Search to analyze the course at the provided URL and identify any prerequisite knowledge or foundational concepts it requires. Search for phrases like "requirements," "prerequisites," or "assumed knowledge."
2.  **Prioritize Foundational Certifications.** Scan the "Available Certifications" list. Your top priority is to find certifications that directly teach the prerequisite skills you identified. If you find any, they MUST be included in your recommendations.
3.  **Find Complementary Certifications.** After addressing prerequisites, find certifications that are a good next step (more advanced) or cover related technologies that would pair well with the skills learned in the course.
4.  **Formulate Recommendations.** Create a final list of up to 4 recommended certification IDs. This list should be prioritized with foundational/prerequisite certifications first, followed by complementary ones.
5.  **Write Specific Reasoning.** For each recommendation, write a clear, concise reason (1-2 sentences). You MUST explicitly state *why* it is being recommended. For example:
    -   For a prerequisite: "This certification is recommended because the course requires foundational Python, and this certification provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming."
    -   For a complement: "This certification is a great next step, allowing you to apply the course's machine learning concepts in a real-world cloud environment like AWS."
6.  **Format Response.** Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with no other text or markdown. The JSON should contain two keys:
    -   "recommendations": An array of certification ID strings.
    -   "reasoning": An array of objects, where each object has an "id" (string) and "reason" (string).

Example JSON format:
{
  "recommendations": ["azure-az900", "aws-cda"],
  "reasoning": [
    { "id": "azure-az900", "reason": "The course description mentions deploying to the cloud, so this certification covers the foundational cloud concepts you'll need to get started." },

The total time for tasks on a given day must not exceed the student's specified availability for that day.
